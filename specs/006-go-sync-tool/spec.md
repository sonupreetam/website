# Feature Specification: Go Content Sync Tool

**Feature Branch**: `006-go-sync-tool`
**Phase**: 2 (Content Infrastructure)

## Overview

The ComplyTime website (`complytime.dev`) documents a growing ecosystem of open-source compliance tools hosted across multiple repositories in the `complytime` GitHub organization. Before this feature, project documentation was manually copied into the site — error-prone, inconsistent, and unable to scale as new repos were added.

This feature replaces that workflow with a Go CLI tool (`cmd/sync-content/`, ~2000 lines across 10 source files in `package main`) that derives the set of eligible repositories from the org's governance registry (`peribolos.yaml` in the `.github` repo), fetches their README content and per-repo metadata via the GitHub REST API, applies Markdown transforms, and generates Hugo-compatible pages and landing page card data. A declarative config overlay (`sync-config.yaml`) provides precision control for repos needing custom documentation layouts.

**Dependencies**: Go 1.25+, `gopkg.in/yaml.v3` (sole third-party Go dep), Hugo 0.155.1 extended, Node.js 22.

## Scope

### In Scope

> IDs are grouped by domain (001–018: core, 030–031: detection, 040–041: site integration, 070: content approval). Gaps between groups are intentional.

| ID | Capability |
|----|-----------|
| IS-001 | Governance-driven repo discovery: fetch `peribolos.yaml` from `{org}/.github` repo, parse `orgs.{org}.repos` map as authoritative repo list, enrich with GitHub API metadata (stars, language, topics) per repo |
| IS-002 | README fetch with base64 decoding and SHA tracking |
| IS-003 | Per-repo page generation: section index (`_index.md`, frontmatter only) + overview page (`overview.md`, README content) |
| IS-004 | Landing page card generation (`data/projects.json`) with type derivation from topics |
| IS-005 | Config-driven file sync with transforms (`inject_frontmatter`, `rewrite_links`, `strip_badges`) |
| IS-006 | Concurrent processing with bounded worker pool (`--workers`) |
| IS-007 | Dry-run by default; `--write` flag required for disk I/O |
| IS-008 | Markdown transforms: `stripLeadingH1`, `stripBadges`, `rewriteRelativeLinks` |
| IS-009 | Repo filtering: exclude archived repos, forks, `--include`/`--exclude` lists |
| IS-012 | Sync manifest (`.sync-manifest.json`) for orphan file tracking |
| IS-014 | Doc page auto-sync from `discovery.scan_paths` directories |
| IS-016 | Single-repo mode (`--repo`): sync only one repository (validated against peribolos) |
| IS-017 | Summary file generation (`--summary report.md`) |
| IS-018 | GitHub CI outputs: `GITHUB_OUTPUT` variables and `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` |
| IS-030 | Two-tier SHA-based change detection (branch SHA + README SHA) |
| IS-031 | Stale content cleanup via manifest diff |
| IS-040 | Dynamic landing page project cards from `data/projects.json` |
| IS-041 | Docs sidebar with collapsed repo-level sections via Hugo cascade |
| IS-070 | Content lockfile (`.content-lock.json`) for SHA-pinned content approval |

### Out of Scope

- `.specify/` artifact sync (fetching upstream `constitution.md`, `spec.md`, `plan.md` into site) — deferred to a future feature
- Private repository access
- GitHub Enterprise / custom API URL
- Log level control (`--verbose` / `--quiet`)
- Config schema versioning

### Edge Cases (Peribolos Integration)

| Case | Expected Behavior |
|------|-------------------|
| Repo in peribolos but archived on GitHub | Excluded by existing archived-repo filter (fetched from API metadata) |
| Repo in peribolos but deleted on GitHub | API metadata fetch returns 404; log warning, skip repo, continue |
| Repo on GitHub but NOT in peribolos | Excluded — governance registry is authoritative |
| `.github` repo missing or peribolos.yaml absent | Fatal error — log and exit non-zero |
| `--org` flag value doesn't match peribolos `orgs` key | Fatal error — log mismatch and exit non-zero |
| `--repo` flag used (single-repo mode) | Validated against peribolos — repo must exist in governance registry; metadata fetched from API |

## User Stories

### US1: Safe Local Preview (Priority: P1) — MVP

**As a** contributor, **I want to** clone the repo, run the sync tool, and preview the full site locally, **so that** I can verify documentation changes without risk.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
- **US1-SC1**: Running without `--write` creates zero files. Tool logs intended actions.
- **US1-SC2**: Running with `--write` generates: (a) section indexes at `content/docs/projects/{repo}/_index.md` (frontmatter only), (b) overview pages at `content/docs/projects/{repo}/overview.md` (README content), (c) doc sub-pages from `discovery.scan_paths`, (d) `data/projects.json`, (e) `.sync-manifest.json`.
- **US1-SC3**: `hugo server` after sync produces zero build errors. Pages accessible at `/docs/projects/`.

### US2: Governance-Driven Discovery (Priority: P1)

**As a** site maintainer, **I want** repos declared in the org's governance registry to automatically appear on the website, **so that** the site reflects the org's official repo list without ad-hoc API discovery.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
- **US2-SC1**: Repos listed in `peribolos.yaml` (and NOT in `sync-config.yaml`) produce: (a) `_index.md` with frontmatter (`title`, `description`, `params.language`, `params.stars`, `params.source_sha`, `params.readme_sha`, `params.seo.*`) and no body, (b) `overview.md` with transformed README content.
- **US2-SC2**: `data/projects.json` contains a `ProjectCard` for every eligible repo from peribolos (non-archived, non-forked), sorted alphabetically, with fields `name`, `language`, `type`, `description`, `url`, `repo`, `stars`.
- **US2-SC3**: Repos present on GitHub but NOT in `peribolos.yaml` are excluded from sync (governance registry is authoritative).
- **US2-SC4**: If `peribolos.yaml` cannot be fetched (e.g., `.github` repo missing or network error), the tool logs an error and exits non-zero rather than silently falling back to API listing.

> **Note**: When `--lock` is active (production deploys), new repos not yet in `.content-lock.json` are skipped until the next content sync check PR (US7) adds them to the lockfile and is merged. The approval gate controls when they reach production.

### US3: Config-Driven Precision Sync (Priority: P1)

**As a** documentation lead, **I want** precise control over specific files' destinations, frontmatter, and transforms, **so that** key projects have customized documentation layouts.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
- **US3-SC1**: For repos with `skip_org_sync: true`, no auto-generated section index or overview page exists, BUT the repo's `ProjectCard` is in `data/projects.json`.
- **US3-SC2**: Config-declared files appear at their `dest` paths with correct transforms applied.

### US4: Change Detection and Stale Cleanup (Priority: P2)

**As a** CI pipeline, **I want** the sync tool to skip unchanged repos and clean up stale content, **so that** builds are fast and the site stays clean.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
- **US4-SC1**: On a second consecutive run, unchanged repos show "unchanged" in log output with zero disk writes.
- **US4-SC2**: When a repo is removed from the org, all generated files (section index, overview, doc sub-pages, entire directory) are cleaned up.

### US5: CI/CD Pipeline Integration (Priority: P2)

**As a** DevOps engineer, **I want** the sync tool to run automatically in GitHub Actions, **so that** production deploys always use reviewed, approved content.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
- **US5-SC1**: Deploy workflow includes Go setup, sync step with `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `--lock`, runs before Hugo build. Content is fetched at approved SHAs from `.content-lock.json`.
- **US5-SC2**: CI workflow validates PRs with `go vet`, `gofmt`, `go test -race`, sync dry-run (with `--lock`), and Hugo build.
- **US5-SC3**: `GITHUB_OUTPUT` contains `has_changes`, `changed_count`, `error_count`. `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` contains a markdown summary. CI deploys proceed even with non-fatal warnings.

### US6: Concurrent Processing with Race Safety (Priority: P3)

**As a** developer, **I want** the tool to process repos concurrently and pass race detection, **so that** processing is fast and correct.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
- **US6-SC1**: `go test -race ./cmd/sync-content/...` passes with zero data race warnings.
- **US6-SC2**: Unit tests cover all pure functions; integration tests verify end-to-end processing with mock API.

### US7: Content Approval Gate (Priority: P2)

**As a** site maintainer, **I want** upstream documentation changes to require human review before reaching production, **so that** broken or undesirable content never deploys automatically.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
- **US7-SC1**: A committed `.content-lock.json` pins each repo to an approved branch SHA. The deploy workflow fetches content at those locked SHAs — not HEAD.
- **US7-SC2**: A weekly check workflow detects upstream changes, updates `.content-lock.json`, and opens a PR. No content change reaches production without a merged PR.
- **US7-SC3**: Running with `--lock` and a repo not in the lockfile skips that repo (unapproved content is not fetched).
- **US7-SC4**: Running with `--lock --update-lock` writes current upstream SHAs to the lockfile for all discovered repos.

## CLI Interface

## Non-Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Target |
|----|------------|--------|
| NFR-001 | Full org sync completes within timeout | < 60s with token |
| NFR-002 | Hugo build time with generated content | < 2s |
| NFR-003 | All logging via `log/slog` with structured fields | — |
| NFR-004 | SPDX license headers on all Go source files | — |
| NFR-005 | All code in `package main` within `cmd/sync-content/`; no unnecessary packages or abstractions | — |
| NFR-006 | Only permitted third-party dep: `gopkg.in/yaml.v3` | — |
| NFR-007 | Generated content gitignored, not committed | — |
| NFR-008 | Idempotent runs: same input produces same output | — |

## Security Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Task |
|----|------------|------|
| SEC-001 | Path traversal prevention: all write paths validated under `--output` directory | T028 |
| SEC-002 | Bounded error response body reads (4KB max) to prevent memory exhaustion | T031 |
| SEC-003 | URL path escaping for all API URL construction to prevent injection | T032 |

## Inherited Capabilities

The following capabilities were ported from the test-website reference implementation and are functional:

- **Two-tier SHA-based change detection**: Branch SHA (`params.source_sha`) for fast pre-filtering; README SHA (`params.readme_sha`) for content-level accuracy
- **Single-repo filtering** (`--repo`): Process one repo (validated against peribolos governance registry)
- **Doc page auto-sync**: Syncs Markdown files from `discovery.scan_paths` directories
- **Context cancellation**: `--timeout` flag with context propagation; retry sleep respects cancellation (IS-061)
- **CI integration outputs**: Writes `GITHUB_OUTPUT` variables and `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` for GitHub Actions; deploys proceed even with non-fatal warnings
- **Content approval gate** (`--lock`): SHA-pinned lockfile gates deployments to reviewed content; weekly check workflow proposes updates via PR

## Success Criteria

All criteria must pass before feature 006 merges to `main`.

| ID | Criterion | Verification |
|----|----------|--------------|
| SC-001 | `go.mod` exists and `go mod verify` passes | `go mod verify` |
| SC-002 | `cmd/sync-content/` compiles without errors | `go build ./cmd/sync-content` |
| SC-003 | Dry-run produces zero files; write mode produces correct output structure | T003, T004 |
| SC-004 | Hugo builds with zero errors after sync | T005 |
| SC-005 | Auto-discovered repos have section index + overview + card | T006, T007 |
| SC-006 | Config overlay applies transforms at declared dest paths | T008, T009 (deferred until sources declared; code paths covered by unit tests) |
| SC-007 | Change detection skips unchanged repos; stale cleanup removes all files | T010 |
| SC-008 | Unit and integration tests pass | T015, T016 |
| SC-009 | `go vet` and `gofmt` pass with zero issues | T019 |
| SC-010 | CI workflow validates PRs with lint, test, dry-run, build | T014 |
| SC-011 | Path traversal prevention rejects paths escaping `--output` directory | T028, T037 |
| SC-012 | Context-aware retry sleep respects cancellation promptly | T029, T037 |
| SC-013 | Stale cleanup removes all generated files (overview.md, doc sub-pages), not just `_index.md` | T030, T037 |
| SC-014 | `--lock` gates content to approved SHAs; unapproved repos are skipped | `lock_test.go`, `sync_test.go` (`TestProcessRepo_LockedSHA`) |
| SC-015 | `--update-lock` writes current upstream SHAs to lockfile | `lock_test.go` (`TestWriteLock`, `TestWriteLock_DeterministicOrder`) |
| SC-016 | Weekly check workflow creates/updates a PR with lockfile changes | `sync-content-check.yml` manual dispatch |

## Merge Readiness Gate

All 16 success criteria (SC-001 through SC-016) MUST pass before merging feature 006 to `main`. SC-006 is deferred (blocked on config sources being declared) but its code paths are covered by unit tests (`TestSyncConfigSource`, `TestProcessRepo`). SC-016 requires a manual `workflow_dispatch` run of `sync-content-check.yml` after merge.
